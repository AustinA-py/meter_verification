# Meter Verification Program

**Introduction**  
This program was developed specifically to address organization specific needs in verifying data entry. The program takes an excel or CSV file from the organization's billing/asset management software and applies logic across the file to identify those records which contain errors in data entry. The program outputs a single excel file with unique each issue annotated in a separate sheet within the workbook.
