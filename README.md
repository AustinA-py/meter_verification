<h1>Meter Verification Program</h1>

<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
<p>This program was developed specifically to address organization specific needs in verifying data entry. The program takes an excel or CSV file from the organization's billing/asset management software and applies logic across the file to identify those records which contain errors in data entry. The program outputs a single excel file with unique each issue annotated in a separate sheet within the workbook.</p>
